- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @John-TMF
- I happened on Brackets while looking for a replacement for Microsoft FrontPage 2000. I've developed and
- maintained a number of websites (3 currently active) on FrontPage. When my primary computer crashed recently,
- I found that my new Win11 laptop will not install my old CD of FrontPage. I'm fairly proficient in HTML,
- having learned it over 20 years ago and taught courses in it at work in 2004-05. So I'm optimistic that
- Brackets will allow me to move forward with the sites I'm responsible for and possibly be the basis for new
- sites.
